Files:
==========
*All the files i submitted, asm.c++ and claims.txt, have my name and student id at the start, along with a declaration of authorship.

The evidence for Assembler including the output files from the test examples has also been uploaded. They are test1(3 output files), test2(3 output files), test3
(3 output file),test4(3 output files), bubble(3 output files), testdata(3 output files). All the test files have been tested and work properly.


*Programs are compilable with g++ asm.cpp -o asm.


=============================
Program format and structure:
=============================
1. The assembler:

*	Can handle any type of input format like trailing spaces, no spaces between ':' or ';', many empty lines.

*	Assembler can detect the following errors:
	- Bogus mnemonic
	- Invalid Label Name
	- Repeated label Name
	- Reference to an invalid label name
	- Label name can not be a keyword
	- Missing operand
	- Unexpected operand
	- Wrong format of numbers
	- Invalid input format
	- There can not be two labels in same line
	- No label for set instruction
	- Label not defined

*	Assembler can issue the following warnings:
	- Unused label
	- Infinite loops

*	Stores mnemonic and their opcodes.
*	Stores defined labels in program.
*	Uses single routine for both pases to assemble the program.
*	Generates an advanced listing file.
*	Generates an object file with .o extension
*	Listing and object files are empty if there are any errors.
*	Can implement the instruction SET.


=============================
Testing:
=============================

# To compile the asm.cpp file:
g++ asm.cpp -o asm
# to run a test file xyz.asm
./asm xyz.asm

1. The assembler:

I have tested five examples shown as below. The errors only occurred in the file test2.asm and testdata.asm.

The others were tested without any errors ( but warnings can be there ) detected and produced three output files: listing file, 
error log file and machine readable object file, for each example. 
 

1)

#Input: asm test1.asm
#Output: 
a. test1.l 
b. test1.log :

Waring :: unused label: "label" at line 2
Waring :: Infintite loop at line: 6

c. test1.o

2)
#Input:asm test2.asm
#Output: 
a. test2.l 
b. test2.log :

Error at line 4: Repeated Label name
Error at line 6: Wrong format of numbers
Error at line 7: missing operand
Error at line 8: unexpected operand
Error at line 9: Wrong format of numbers
Error at line 10: Invalid Label name
Error at line 11: Bogus mnemonic
Error at line 12: Bogus mnemonic
Error at line 5: label not defined
Waring :: unused label: "label" at line 3

c. test2.o


3)
#Input:asm test3.asm
#Output: 
a. test3.l 
b. test3.log (without any error messages)
c. test3.o


4)
#Input:asm test4.asm
#Output: 
a. test4.l 
b. test4.log (without any error messages)
c. test4.o

5)
#Input:asm testdata.asm
#Output: 
a. testdata.l 
b. testdata.log :
